## Your Question:
> "Can u tell me what happened here & why my pr got this fraud tag?"

## The Answer:
**Your PR never got a fraud tag!** üéâ

There was a misunderstanding about what happened. Let me explain:

---

## What Really Happened:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wrong File Location
You put files in the **wrong place** (root directory instead of `lib/domains/com/`)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Saw "abused.txt" Being Updated  
Your second PR updated a file called `lib/domains/abused.txt` and you thought it meant YOUR college was being accused of fraud

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What "abused.txt" Actually Is
It's a list of domains that OTHER people abused for fraudulent license requests. **Your college is NOT on this list.**
