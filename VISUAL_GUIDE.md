# Visual Guide: What Went Wrong and How It Was Fixed

## The Problem: File Placement

### ❌ What You Did (Incorrect):

```
swot/ (repository root)
├── file.zip                    ← WRONG: Added to root directory
├── subodhpgcollege.txt        ← WRONG: Added to root directory
├── lib/
│   └── domains/
│       ├── edu/
│       │   └── stanford.txt
│       └── com/
│           └── google.txt
```

### ✅ What Should Have Been Done (Correct):

```
swot/ (repository root)
├── lib/
│   └── domains/
│       ├── edu/
│       │   └── stanford.txt
│       └── com/
│           ├── google.txt
│           └── subodhpgcollege.txt  ← CORRECT: Domain file in proper location
```

## Domain Structure Examples

The swot repository uses **reversed domain notation**:

| Domain                    | File Path                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `stanford.edu`            | `lib/domains/edu/stanford.txt`        |
| `mit.edu`                 | `lib/domains/edu/mit.txt`             |
| `oxford.ac.uk`            | `lib/domains/uk/ac/oxford.txt`        |
| `unaab.edu.ng`            | `lib/domains/ng/edu/unaab.txt`        |
| `subodhpgcollege.com`     | `lib/domains/com/subodhpgcollege.txt` |

## PR #2: What Actually Happened

Your PR #2 wasn't adding just your college - it was **merging 1,640 files** from JetBrains/swot!

```
Your PR #2 Changes:
├── README.md (updated)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md (updated)
├── lib/domains/abused.txt (1,402 lines updated)  ← This caused confusion
├── lib/domains/ac/in/delhitechnicalcampus.txt (added)
├── lib/domains/academy/londonschool.txt (added)
├── ... (1,635+ more files changed or added)
└── subodhpgcollege.txt was still in wrong place
```

The `abused.txt` file is a list of domains that have been abused for fraudulent license requests. **Your college is NOT on this list.** The file was just being updated as part of syncing with JetBrains' latest changes.

## The "Fraud" Misunderstanding

```
What you probably saw:

GitHub PR #2 → Changed files → lib/domains/abused.txt
                                      ↑
                                   This word!
                                      
                                   +abused.txt contains:
                                    - si.edu
                                    - america.edu
                                    - liberty.edu
                                    - ...

You thought: "Does this mean my PR is fraudulent?"

Reality: NO! This is a list maintained by JetBrains of domains 
         that OTHER people abused. Your college is NOT on it.
```

## Correct Process for JetBrains/swot

```
Step 1: Fork JetBrains/swot
  └─ Creates: your-username/swot

Step 2: Create a new branch
  └─ git checkout -b add-subodh-college

Step 3: Add ONLY your college file
  └─ Create: lib/domains/com/subodhpgcollege.txt
             Content: "SS Jain Subodh PG College"

Step 4: Commit and push
  └─ git add lib/domains/com/subodhpgcollege.txt
  └─ git commit -m "Add SS Jain Subodh PG College"
  └─ git push origin add-subodh-college

Step 5: Create PR to JetBrains/swot
  └─ Title: "Add SS Jain Subodh PG College"
  └─ Description: Include college info, website, proof of domain
  └─ Changes: Should show ONLY 1 file added (not 1,640!)
```

## Summary

| Aspect              | What Happened          | What Should Happen                    |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| File location       | Root directory         | `lib/domains/com/subodhpgcollege.txt` |
| Number of files     | 1,640 files changed    | 1 file added                          |
| Fraud accusation    | None (misunderstood)   | None                                  |
| Current status      | Fixed in this PR       | Ready for proper submission           |

## Conclusion

**You are innocent!** This was a simple technical mistake, not fraud. The repository now has the correct structure, and you can submit it properly to JetBrains/swot when ready.
