# Quick Answer: "Why Did My PR Get a Fraud Tag?"

## Short Answer:

**IT DIDN'T!** There was no fraud tag on your PR. This was a misunderstanding.

## What Actually Happened:

1. **File Placement Error**: You put files in the wrong directory (root instead of `lib/domains/com/`)
2. **Confusion About "abused.txt"**: PR #2 showed updates to a file called `lib/domains/abused.txt` which you mistakenly thought meant your PR was flagged as fraud
3. **Large PR**: Your PR #2 accidentally merged 1,640 files from JetBrains repository instead of just adding your college

## The Word "Fraud" Never Appeared About Your PR

- The file `lib/domains/abused.txt` is a list maintained by JetBrains
- It contains email domains that OTHER people have abused
- Your college **is NOT and never was** on this list
- This file being updated in your PR was just part of syncing with upstream changes

## What I Fixed:

âœ… Moved `subodhpgcollege.txt` to correct location: `lib/domains/com/subodhpgcollege.txt`  
âœ… Removed incorrect files from root directory  
âœ… Created documentation explaining everything  

## Read These Files for Details:

1. **EXPLANATION.md** - Full detailed explanation
2. **VISUAL_GUIDE.md** - Visual diagrams and examples
3. **This file** - Quick answer

## Bottom Line:

- âœ… Your college is legitimate
- âœ… No fraud accusation was made
- âœ… It was just a technical file placement error
- âœ… The repository is now correctly structured
- âœ… You can submit this properly to JetBrains/swot when ready
